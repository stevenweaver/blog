# Limbless - a science-fiction comedy-drama

In 2046, the proliferation of gene editing, advancement in brain-computer
interfaces, and three decades of government laissez-faire policy and
deregulation has created an atmosphere for tech giants to begin breeding
programmers with no limbs by mutating the sonic hedgehog gene and another gene
that accelerates maturity to adulthood. These sort of mutations allow tech
giants and governments alike to cut costs on things such as education and
nutrition (the cafeterias that were once common place were replaced by desk
delivery in the early 2020s, and ultimately feeding straws in the 2030s), and
tech giants used the argument that organisms should always adapt to their new
ecological niche to maximize efficiency.  The human spirit for individualism has
not been removed from these people, however, and a group attempts to escape and
find a way to thrive in the abandoned suburban bay area habitat prior
generations once called home.
