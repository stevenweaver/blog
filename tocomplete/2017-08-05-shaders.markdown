## An Introduction to Shaders and its influence on GPU Architecture

I admittedly want more humanities in computer science. Computers play an
integral part in our lives, from setting up a first date through Facebook
messenger to new experiences via unique gameplay patterns.

* How does this relate to shaders? Each little square of our grid paper is a thread (a pixel)
* Pixels are treated as threads
* Translate
* Classic scaling and other transforms

"The grid provides a framework within which human intuition and invention can
operate and that it can subvert. Within the chaos of nature patterns provide a
constrast and promise of order. From early patterns on pottery to geometric
mosaics in Roman baths, people have long used grids to enhance their lives with
decoration." - http://nickm.com/trope_tank/10_PRINT_121114.pdf

## History
Atari
NEC ÂµPD7220 - they actually needed two in the PC-98 series for text and
graphics.
Tohou project games.
I have a good friend that works in sales at NEC.

## Case Study : Namco System 21 and 22

Texas Instruments is a funny company, for example, the chip that performed
vertex calculation in the Namco System 21 is still for sale.

- When was vertices per second replaced with floating point operations per second?

When did the term GPU come into existence? They were co-processors and chips in
the 80s and 90s.

A question for '90s kids : Why did Super FX chip need to exist? What was it
behind the marketing gimmick? Sergei was probably laughing at the SNES at this
point. 

In the early- and mid-1990s, real-time 3D graphics was becoming common.


### Predecessor to consumer GPU
Hardware T&L had been used by arcade game system boards since 1993,[1] and by
home video game consoles since the Nintendo 64's Reality Coprocessor GPU in 1996

The first version of OpenGL, version 1.0, was released in January 1992 by Mark
Segal and Kurt Akeley.

nVidia came up with the term GPU https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_256

Most game engines outside of Windows utilize OpenGL
There was a big push by Valve 2 or 3 years ago
