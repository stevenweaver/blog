### Introduction

The opioid epidemic has been an ongoing struggle for many years, especially in
the Midwest and Northeast.<sup>3</sup> The epidemic is considered so severe that
it has become a regular bipartisan issue in politics. As evidenced by both
President Obama and President Trump declaring it a crisis that must be
addressed. Indeed, just this week, President Trump has declared a Nationwide
Public Health Emergency to address the opioid crisis. 

Ongoing speculation has been targeted on what may be the excessive prescription
of opioid drugs and the potential affects it may have on the rise of heroin
abuse and death by overdose. President Barack Obama, at a community discussion
in especially hard-hit West Virginia, explicitly stated that "Prescription drugs
become a gateway to heroin. As a consequence, between 2002 and 2013, the number
of heroin-related deaths in America nearly quadrupled." in 2015.  <sup>1</sup>
President Trump's approach to tackling the issue can be summed up by his
statement “The best way to prevent drug addiction and overdose is to prevent
people from abusing drugs in the first place.  If they don’t start, they won't
have a problem.” <sup>2</sup> Both the FDA and the CDC are making efforts to
regulate how often these prescription drugs are prescribed, and to make the
public more aware of the dangers associated with opioid pain relievers,
respectively.

### Statistics

According to the NIH, in 2016 more than 11.5 million Americans ages 12 and
older reported misuse of prescription opioids in the past year, and nearly
950,000 reported heroin use in the past year.<sup>10</sup>

In addition, according to the Centers for Disease Control, there were over
22,000 deaths involving prescription opioids, equivalent to 62 deaths a day, a
significant increase from 19,000 in 2014.  <sup>9</sup> Deaths from synthetic
opioids seem to be contributing to the rapid death rate increase, of which
fentanyl is a primary concern. What makes fentanyl especially dangerous is that
it is 50x more potent than heroin, and 100x more potent than morphine. Fentanyl
can be legally prescribed, but its intent is only for those with acute and
chronic pain associated with cancer.  As we will see later in the paper, doctors
who prescribe this medication inappropriately can go under serious investigation
and could ultimately lose their license.

In the past few years, heroin and synthetic opioids have become bigger threats.
Some addicts have moved from one class of opioid to another. The Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimates that almost four out of five new
heroin users previously abused prescription drugs.

It clear that there is an association between the increasing rate of opioid
prescribing and increasing opioid-related morbidity and mortality.

### John Kapoor and Insys Pharmeuciticals - Background


With the obvious dangers associated with the misuse of prescription opioids, the
idea that providers of these medications promoting its abuse should disgust even
the most ardent supporters of the so-called "free market". However, John Kapoor
of Insys Pharmaceuticals, among others, are facing charges of just that by
violating the "anti-kickback statute" <sup>13</sup>

*John Kapoor - Insys Therapeutics Founder*

According to the release made by the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of
Massachussetts <sup>14</sup>

Kapoor, among others

> conspired to bribe practitioners in various states, many of whom operated pain
> clinics, in order to get them to prescribe a fentanyl-based pain medication.
> The medication, called “Subsys,” is a powerful narcotic intended to treat
> cancer patients suffering intense breakthrough pain.  In exchange for bribes
> and kickbacks, the practitioners wrote large numbers of prescriptions for the
> patients, most of whom were not diagnosed with cancer.

In addition to John Kapoor, a doctor is also facing losing his license and a
lawsuit by the New Jersey Attorney General Porrino.<sup>8</sup>

> Dr. Kenneth P. Sun, a pain management practitioner in Phillipsburg, was paid up
> to $12,100 a month by drug maker Insys Therapeutic Inc. (“Insys”) for speaking
> engagements and consulting services, all the while prescribing to patients
> Subsys, a tightly-restricted oral spray medication approved by the federal Food
> and Drug Administration (“FDA”) strictly for use in treating breakthrough cancer
> pain in opioid-tolerant patients.

Porrino's office also cited emails the doctor received from Insys staff. In one
email, an Insys rep told Sun to "keep them rolling," referring to a patient
who'd just won insurance coverage for the pain drug.

### Ethical Considerations

When deciding on how to address the issue of prescription opioids, we must work
within an ethical decision-making framework. This allows the individual to think
about *why* an action is right or wrong instead of working primarily on
instinct, a situation where often our judgment is clouded by what would benefit
ourselves most as opposed making a functional society that benefits everyone
long-term.

#### Utilitarian

When considering the utilitarian approach, we ask the question "Of any two
actions, which one will produce the greatest balance of benefits over harms?".
Most people who take prescription pain killers do not abuse them and certainly
do not progress to heroin. The drug works as intended, and they are relieved
from living a much more painful life. Roughly one out of four people prescribed
opioids misuse them, and only 6% transition to heroin.<sup>15</sup>

If we continue to allow prescription opioid medication to be prescribed at the
current rate, the majority of people would benefit from them. However, the
people who develop a disorder are negatively impacted in a very meaninful way. I
would argue that a weight needs to be applied to be able to accurately assess
whether the net good outweight the bad. For example, if taking the drug improves
an individual's life by 20% for those that do not develop issues, and degrades a
person's life by 90% for those that are negatively impacted, then the
utilitarian answer is that the drugs should only be prescribed as much as those
weights to equal out. Under those rates, the percentage of people negatively
impacted would have to be reduced to 18%.

#### Justice

When considering the justice approach, we must consider the question "does this
action treat everyone the same way, or does it show favoritism and
discrimination?". When considering Insys's actions, it is quite clear that they
were in violation of the law if the allegations are true. To not indict them
with the evidence provided would not be fair or just. More difficult action to
make is to whether to strengthen regulations on prescription opioid use. Is it
fair to discriminate against those with pain because a minority of them are
likely to abuse the medication? Isn't that sort of policy the same as
stereotyping? Which we vehemently denounce?

#### Common Good (Hippocratic Oath)

When considering the common good approach, the question is "what action advances
the commond good?", or to identify a society we wish to live in and strive for.
Surely, we do not want to live in a society with 25%+ of people hampered by drug
abuse. It causes the people around them grief, reduces positive productivity in
society, and increases expenses to help take care of the ones that are affected.
In addition, the people affected have a severely diminished quality of life,
which is by definition antithetical to striving for the common good.

#### Virtue

When considerin the virtue approach, we must answer the question "what action
develops moral virtues in ourselves and our communities?". Drug addiction
violates our unified value of self-control. To enable such addiction is neither
compassionate nor generous. When Insys bribed doctors with money to prescribe
medication when they should have not, they violated these commonly held virtues.

### Conclusions

To rapidly reduce the use of prescription opioid pain killers immediately would
be rash. While it is reported that the incidence of heroin use among people who
reported prior nonmedical use of prescription opioids was over 19 times as high
as those that did not, the number of people who use prescription opioids rarely
progress to using heroin. <sup>6</sup> If policies and practices instituted to reduce the
number of inppropriate prescriptions are too strict, it could fuel increases in
in rates of heroin use and death due to dependency.<sup>11</sup>

A combination of behavorial healthcare, as proposed by Senator Elizabeth
Warren<sup>12</sup>, to help the needs of those already addicted in addition to
preventative measures like greater regulation of what and when can be prescribed
are both necessary to ensure that heroin abuse does continue its upward trend.
This would be the just, advance the common good, be utilitarian, and virtuous
actions to take.

Conducting business to maximize profit often creates ethical issues. Addicted
customers is a good thing in a business context, but it is shameful when
considering that these are people's children, parents, spouses, and other loved
ones whose lives are being destroyed due to this practices. It is not
utilitarian for society as a whole and is in direct conflict with the common
good.

Our government should become more prevantative than reactionary. Addictive
prescription drugs should be regulated and monitored from the outset. With the
rise of big data and rapid communication, a greater effort to put in place solid
data science that recognizes and reports odd behavior in monetary spending and
prescription practices should be put in to play immediately. Surely, this action
passes all the checkboxes in any ethical framework.
